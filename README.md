![](/icon.png) IWC-SignalR
===

Browsers have a limitation of the maximum number of connections to the same host address (same application).
So, this limits the maximum number of opened browser windows of the same application with SignalR connections.
**IWC-SignalR** allows to bypass this restriction using single SignalR connection for all windows of the same application.
**IWC-SignalR** was tested with SignalR v2.2.0.

# How it works
One of the windows becomes a connection owner (choosen randomly) and holds the real SignalR connection.
If connection owner is closed or crashed another window becomes a connection owner - this happens automatically.
Inter-window communication is done by means of [IWC](https://github.com/slimjack/IWC).

# Usage
To use **IWC-SignalR** include *signalr-patch.js* and *iwc-signalr.js* files on your page. *signalr-patch.js* allows to start SignalR multiple times. This allows to reconfigure hub proxies at any time.

**IWC-SignalR** works with auto generated proxies. So, you should also include a reference `<script src="signalr/hubs"></script>` before *signalr-patch.js* and *iwc-signalr.js*. For example:

```html
<!--Reference the SignalR library. -->
<script src=".../jquery.signalR-2.2.0.min.js"></script>
<!--Reference the autogenerated SignalR hub script. -->
<script src="signalr/hubs"></script>

<script src=".../iwc-all.js"></script>
<script src=".../signalr-patch.js"></script>
<script src=".../iwc-signalr.js"></script>
```

Let's have a hub `Echo` with method `Send` defined on server. Method `Send` calls method `displayMsg` of all clients.

```js
var echoHub = SJ.iwc.SignalR.getHubProxy('echo', {
    client: {
        displayMsg: function (msg) {
          console.log(msg);
        }
    }
});
SJ.iwc.SignalR.start().done(function () {
    console.log('started');
    echoHub.server.send('test').done(function () {
        console.log('sent');
    });
});
//Result in console:
//started
//test
//sent
```

# Dependencies
**IWC-SignalR** depends on [**IWC**](https://github.com/slimjack/IWC)


# API

#### Connection starting
`SJ.iwc.SignalR.start()`

###### Parameters and return value:
This function has the same signature as the original `$.connection.hub.start` function

###### Description:
`SJ.iwc.SignalR.start` when called it tries to find connection owner and connect to it via **IWC**.
If connection owner not found, real SignalR connection is established and this window becomes a connection owner.

#### Obtaining hub proxy
`{object}SJ.iwc.SignalR.getHubProxy({string}hubName, {object}proxyConfig)`

###### Parameters:
- `hubName` - hub name according to SignalR naming convention (starts from lower case letter)
- `proxyConfig` - object which contains definition of client's methods

###### Return value:
Returns hub proxy object with server and client

###### Description:
Creates hub proxy object with server and client. Usage of server and client doesn't depend on whether the SignalR connection is real or via **IWC**.

###### Example:
```js
var echoHub = SJ.iwc.SignalR.getHubProxy('echo', {
    client: {
        displayMsg: function (msg) {
          console.log(msg);
        }
    }
});

echoHub.server.send('test');
```

#### Check if conection owner
`{bool}SJ.iwc.SignalR.isConnectionOwner()`

###### Return value:
Returns true if this window is the owner of SignalR connection


#### Who is conection owner
`{string}SJ.iwc.SignalR.getConnectionOwnerWindowId()`

###### Return value:
Returns the ID of connection owner window. Returns null if connection owner not found.

###### Description:
This method works properly only if ``SJ.iwc.WindowMonitor`` is initialized.


#### Current state
`SJ.iwc.SignalR.getState()`

###### Return value:
Returns connection state (see SignalR's `$.connection.connectionState` for available values)

###### Description:
Returns the state of real SignalR connection


#### Connection Id
`SJ.iwc.SignalR.getConnectionId()`

###### Return value:
Returns connection id (see SignalR's `$.connection.hub.id`)

###### Description:
Returns the connection id of real SignalR connection

#### Events
Use `SJ.iwc.SignalR.on()` and `SJ.iwc.SignalR.un()` to subscribe/unsubscribe on events

- `statechanged(newState, prevState)` - fired when connection state is changed. `newState`, `prevState` - new and previous state (see SignalR's `$.connection.connectionState` for available values)
- `connected` - fired when state is changed to `$.connection.connectionState.connected`
- `starting`, `received`, `connectionslow`, `reconnecting`, `reconnected`, `disconnected` - are the same events as for original SignalR connection

###### Example:
```js
var someObject = {
    onStateChanged: function (newState, prevState) {
    }
};
//subscribe
SJ.iwc.SignalR.on('statechanged', someObject.onStateChanged, someObject);
//unsubscribe
SJ.iwc.SignalR.un('statechanged', someObject.onStateChanged, someObject);
```
